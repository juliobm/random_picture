# random_picture
Send a random picture from your stock by Telegram

Select a picture from your photo stock, and send it by Telegram to your family!
Perhaps the most rewarding script that I made.

You must change in the python script  random_picture.py:
- name of selected picture
- where you have your photos
- where you save the log file
- where you save the file that contains the directories to exclude from random search

Obviously you must change too, the Id user to send by Telegram in the telegram.sh file

And finally put the scripts in your crontab (programmed tasks)
